Contains Magma scripts for generating the public key of the Dob encryption scheme, as well as an implementation of the attack on this construction.

## Overview

The first script generates the public key of a Dob encryption scheme with various parameter choices. A GrÃ¶bner basis can be computed directly from this. The second script recovers the system \mathcal{G}, as described in Section 6.2 of the article. The third script recovers a basis for the oplus modification, v_1*,...,v_k*, as described in Section 6.3 of the article.

## Restrictions

Script two and three requires the previous script(s) in order to run. The attack has only been implemented with the use of three variable sets, W_1, W_2 and W_3, in the gluing process. Furthermore, only the cases k = 0 and k > 3, where k is the number of linear forms in the oplus modification, have been implemented.
